# Data Analysis Script

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from its [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`, and install the Python extension for VS Code.

1. **Create a new project:**
   - Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project, then open that folder in VS Code.
   - Create a new Python file for your script, for example, `analysis.py`.

1. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   - Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+` ` or View > Terminal).
   - Run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named `venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows, run `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.
     - On macOS and Linux, run `source venv/bin/activate`.
   - Your terminal should now show the name of your virtual environment, indicating it's activated.

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   - With your virtual environment activated, install pandas and any other libraries you might need for data analysis, such as numpy, matplotlib, or seaborn, using pip. For example, `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.

1. **Start coding your data analysis script:**
   - Begin by importing the libraries you'll need at the top of your `analysis.py` file. For example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import numpy as np
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     ```
   - Use GitHub Copilot to help write the rest of your script. Start by describing in comments what you want to do, and Copilot can suggest code based on your descriptions. For example:
     ```python
     # Load the data.csv file into a pandas DataFrame
     ```
   - Accept suggestions from Copilot that fit your needs, and continue describing and coding your analysis step by step, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

1. **Run your script:**
   - Run your script directly in VS Code's integrated terminal using the command `python analysis.py`.
   - Examine the output, debug as necessary, and iterate on your analysis.

1. **Explore and expand:**
   - Now that you have a basic data analysis script, use GitHub Copilot to explore more complex data manipulation, perform advanced analyses, or create more detailed visualizations.
   - Try adding documentation and unit testing
