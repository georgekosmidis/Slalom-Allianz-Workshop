# Other Languages to C# Translation Tool

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Ensure .NET SDK is installed on your system for C# development. You can download it from the official .NET website.
   - Make sure Java SDK is installed for running Java source code. Download it from the official Java website.
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from its official website for a robust editing experience.
   - In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and install the C# extension and the Java extension from Red Hat for better language support. Consider installing the GitHub Copilot extension as well for AI-powered coding assistance.

1. **Open the example3 folder project:**
   - Launch VS Code and go to `File` > `Open Folder`.
   - The folder `src` contains 4 examples of the Fibonacci Series, written in C++, Haskel, Java and Python.
   - For C# translation output, create a `CSharpOutput` folder.


1. **Translate any of the 4 to C#:**
   - Start the translation process by exploring ways Github Copilot can help you:
     - Try inline commenting:
     - Try pasting code in the Github Copilot chat
     - Try Github Copilot chat with the file open on the right
     - Try the #selection  and #editor variables
     
1. **Refine and expand:**
   - After successfully translating basic functionality from your chosen language to C#, use the project as a foundation for further development.
   - Explore advanced C# features not present in Java to enhance your application, using GitHub Copilot for code suggestions and best practices.
   - Ask GitHub Copilot how to extend the solution and add performance metrics.
   - Try adding documentation and unit testing
